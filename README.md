> __Abstract:__
> In these polarized and challenging times, not even perceptions of personal risk are immune to partisanship. This paper introduces results from a new survey with an embedded social media experiment conducted during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Descriptive results show that pro-government and opposition partisans report very
different expectations of health and job risks. Job and health policy have become wedge issues that elicit partisan responses. We exploit random variation in the survey recruitment to show the effects of the Presidentâ€™s first speech on national TV on perceived risk and the moderating effect of partisanship. We present a framing experiment that models key cognitive mechanisms driving partisan differences in perceptions of health risks and job security during the COVID-19 crisis.

## Tutorial 

This README file provides an overview of the replications materials for the article. The R codes used in the article can be found under the folder Codes. The survey data, which we fully describe below, is under the folder data. Results are exported to the folder output. 

## Codes

- `CV_analysis_descriptive.R`: Implements the first descriptive analysis of the paper. The code replicates figures 1 and 2 of the paper, and figure 6 and table 6 in the SIF. 

- `CV_analysis_diff_in_diff.R`: Replicates the diff-in-diff results for the Speech of Bolsonaro on risk perceptions. (table 1, figures 7, and 8).

- `CV_analysis_experiments.R`: Replicates the results for the social framing experiment, including the section unpacking the null findings. 

## Data

Our paper presents analyses based on observation, quasi-experimental, and a framing experiment using novel data from a national online survey fielded by Netquest-Vanderbilt. The survey uses probabilistic samples drawn by the LAPOP team in Vanderbilt implemented with the panel of users registered with Netquest.  The entire survey and the embedded framing experiment received the approval of the University of Maryland Institutional Board Review 1552091-3.
